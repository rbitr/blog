# blog

Not really a blog, more of a random place for things I was playing with, and mostly for myself so I don't forget them

- Playing with Tensorflow: https://github.com/rbitr/blog/blob/master/tutorial.md 
- Influence functions for sample based explainability: https://github.com/rbitr/blog/blob/master/IF.md
- Something silly I tried to do parsing files: https://github.com/rbitr/blog/blob/master/gnu_timing.md
